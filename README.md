F12Tools
========

A talk about client-side debugging and tooling. See the live demo slides at [f12talk.azurewebsites.net](http://f12talk.azurewebsites.net). These update anytime I change this repo so they may be a little different from any given talk.

PyOhio 2015 attendees - To see the version used at PyOhio (which had some .NET stuff removed), visit [f12talk-pyohio.azurewebsites.net/](http://f12talk-pyohio.azurewebsites.net/)
